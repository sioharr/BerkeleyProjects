# BerkeleyProjects

My name is Siobhan Harrington and I attended UC Berekeley for their Masters of Information and Data Science program from 2017-2019. Most classes had a final project assigned, and I have compiled my projects here for review.

W200 - Intro to Data Science Programming (python) 
W203 - Statistics for Data Science (R)
W207 - Applied Machine Learning (python)
W241 - Experiments and Causal Inference (R)
W271 - Machine Learning at Scale (python, hadoop, spark)
W209 - Data Visualization (tableau, d3)
W210 - Capstone (python)

For more information on any of these classes, please see the UC Berkeley site - https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci.
