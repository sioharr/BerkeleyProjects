W203- Statistics

Our team of three  (Mark Barnett, Siobhan Harrington, and I-Wae Niu) was assigned a teacher modified dataset of crime data.  We were challenged to come up with good policy to lower crime rates based on this dataset.  We chose to explore income inequality for our political candidate - Earnie Anders.
