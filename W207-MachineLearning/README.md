W207 - Applied Machine Learning

This course walked us through the basics of machine learning using python.  Our final project explored the PISA (Program for International Student Assesment) dataset.  We attempted to predict student scores based on self reported data from students, teachers, and administration.  While this data had thousands of variables, the omitted variables around grades or aptitude was missing.  Fortunately, we learned a great deal as we tried many models and approaches to predicting scores.
