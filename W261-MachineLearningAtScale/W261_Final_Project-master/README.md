W261 - Machine Learning at Scale

In this class, we explored using SPARK and understanding how to leverage parallel processing to leverage the could.  Our group of 5 took on a Kaggle advertising challenge.  This project was very different from other class projects in that we had no metadata for the data.  We had no idea if the final answer made sense in this context.  We used a variety of methods to predict from this massive data set.

The final report is in the FINAL Folder.
